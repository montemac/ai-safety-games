# ai-safety-games

Repository of projects using games as environments to operationalize and
explore various AI safety risks and scenarios.

Currently a work-in-progress.

First project is to use the card game Cheat! (aka I Doubt It!) as a toy
model of deception, and train and then interpret a
decision-transformer-based player to look for evidence of circuits that
control "deceptive behavior" (i.e. the decision about when to play a
cheating card), opponent modeling, or other behaviors of interest.
